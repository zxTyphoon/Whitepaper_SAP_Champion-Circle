# Champions Circle: Enhancing Achievement Evaluation with LLM Integration

## Overview
This repository contains the LaTeX source files and the compiled PDF for the white paper titled **"Creating an LLM extension for Achievements Dashboard: PoC Development for SAP Labs India"**.

### Abstract
This whitepaper outlines the development of a Proof of Concept (PoC) to integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) extension into the Champions Circle software at SAP Labs India. The Champions Circle platform recognizes and rewards employees for exceptional achievements, but its recommendation process is manual and time-intensive. The proposed LLM extension streamlines this process by evaluating recommendations at the initial stage, providing scores and explanatory feedback to assist decision-making.

The PoC involved creating a test environment using modern web technologies like Vite, Node.js, and JavaScript, alongside simplified criteria and questions stored in .csv files. By dynamically adjusting questions based on selected categories and integrating LLM functionality via prompt engineering, the system delivered accurate evaluations. The results demonstrated the LLMâ€™s ability to assess achievements effectively while adhering to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Key findings highlighted the importance of well-defined criteria, iterative prompt refinement, and dynamic interfaces in enhancing evaluation accuracy and user experience. Future steps include expanding criteria, transitioning to SAP UI5 and CAP for production integration, refining prompt engineering with diverse temperature settings, and conducting comprehensive testing.

This PoC represents a scalable and innovative approach to optimizing achievement evaluations, ensuring fair and efficient recognition processes for the Champions Circle platform.
